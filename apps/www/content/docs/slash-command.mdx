<PackageInfo>

## Features

- Quick insertion of various elements using slash commands
- Customizable menu options and styles

</PackageInfo>


## Installation

```bash
npm install @udecode/plate-slash-command
```

## Usage

```tsx
// ...
import { SlashPlugin } from '@udecode/plate-slash-command/react';

const editor = usePlateEditor({
  id: 'slash-demo',
  override: {
    components: {
      ...otherPlateComponents,
      [SlashInputPlugin.key]: SlashInputElement,
    },
  },
  plugins: [...otherPlatePlugins, SlashPlugin],
  value: slashValue,
});
```

## Customization options

Make sure to add the `SlashInputElement` component to your code.

You can see the `rules` in this file. Feel free to configure the options you need

```ts
interface SlashCommandRule {
  icon: ComponentType<SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>>;
  onSelect: (editor: PlateEditor) => void;
  value: string;
  focusEditor?: boolean;
  keywords?: string[];
}
```

Let's explore the configuration options for each slash command:

- `icon`: React component
  - Renders the icon displayed before the slash command option

- `onSelect`: Function(editor: PlateEditor) => void
  - Called when the option is selected
  - Receives the `editor` as an argument for performing actions

- `value`: string
  - Display text for the slash command option in the menu
  - Used for filtering when entering text

- `focusEditor`: boolean (optional, default: true)
  - Will explain this option in the next section

- `keywords`: string[] (optional)
  - Additional search terms for finding this option

These configuration options provide flexibility in customizing the behavior and appearance of slash commands in your editor.


## Focusing outside the editor

By default, the editor maintains focus after selecting a slash command option. This behavior is generally desirable, as it allows users to seamlessly continue editing after inserting a new element. To achieve this, we automatically call `focusEditor(editor)` after the `onSelect` function is executed.

This automatic focus mechanism ensures a smooth editing experience, enabling users to immediately type or make further edits after inserting an element via the slash menu.

However, in certain scenarios, we may need to shift focus outside the editor to enhance the user experience. For instance:

1. **AIPlugin**: When selecting an AI option, we might want to move focus to an input field where users can write their prompts.
2. **EquationPlugin**: When inserting a math equation, focus may need to shift to a specialized input within a math popover.

In such cases, we can set the `focusEditor` option to `false` for the specific slash command. This prevents the automatic refocusing of the editor, allowing us to manually control focus as needed.

Here is an example: 
```ts
const rules: SlashCommandRule[] = [
   ...otherSlashCommands,
   {
      focusEditor: false,
      icon: Icons.ai,
      keywords: ['ai', 'generate', 'help', 'chat'],
      value: 'AI',
      onSelect: (editor) => {
        const nodeEntry = getAncestorNode(editor)!;
        const dom = toDOMNode(editor, nodeEntry[0])!;

        //We have encapsulated the logic for focusing the input in the show API
        editor.getApi(AIPlugin).ai.show(editor.id, dom, nodeEntry);

        editor.setOptions(AIPlugin, {
          aiState: 'idle',
          menuType: 'selection',
        });

        editor.getApi(AIPlugin).ai.show(editor.id, dom, nodeEntry);

        setTimeout(() => {
          editor
            .getApi(BlockSelectionPlugin)
            .blockSelection.addSelectedRow(nodeEntry[0].id as string);
        }, 0);
      },
    }
];
```
