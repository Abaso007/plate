title: MCP Server
description: Use the Model Context Protocol with Plate.
---

Plate has an official MCP server. This lets AI tools understand and work with our rich ecosystem of editor blocks (templates), plugin configurations, and UI components.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. This is useful for Plate because you can now give your AI-assisted IDE direct access to hundreds of Plate resources.

## Using MCP with Plate

Your AI can now:

- Access to all our editor templates, plugins, and UI components
- Generate code with the right imports and configurations
- Help with setting up full editor instances or specific features
- Keep your Plate configurations and components up to date

Try asking your AI:

```bash
"Set up a Plate editor with basic formatting and table support"
"Add the Plate AI plugin and components to my current editor"
"Update my editor components to the latest version"
```

## How it works

The Plate registry provides structured information about our resources that MCP-enabled tools can read:

- Editor templates
- Plugin configurations
- UI components
- Dependencies and requirements for all files
- Documentation and migration guides (coming soon)

## Setup MCP

Copy and paste the code into `.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` for Windsurf)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadcn": {
      "description": "shadcn/ui components",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "shadcn@canary", "registry:mcp"]
    },
    "plate": {
      "description": "Plate editors, plugins and components",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "platejs@canary", "registry:mcp"],
      "env": {
        "REGISTRY_URL": "https://platejs.org//r/registry.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `shadcn` is the MCP server for shadcn/ui components.
- `plate` is the MCP server for Plate components.

## Best Practices

1.  Let AI handle editor setup, plugin integration, and component additions.
2.  Use the [shadcn CLI](/docs/components/cli) for manual additions or when AI needs a fallback. This may happen when using a small model or when our documentation is not up to date.
3.  Regularly check our [changelog](/docs/components/changelog) or ask your AI about updates to keep your Plate resources current.
