title: Introduction
description: Plate UI is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.
---

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.**

You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.

This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn't included in the library. **Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**

This is what Plate UI aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modification.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable and compatible with shadcn/ui.
- **Distribution:** A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.
- **AI-Ready:** Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.

## Open Code

Plate UI hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:

- **Full Transparency:** You see exactly how each component is built.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.
- **AI Integration:** Access to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.

_In a typical library, if you need to change a component's behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With Plate UI, you simply edit the component code directly._

## Composition

Every component in Plate UI shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.**

_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones._

## Distribution

Plate UI leverages the power and flexibility of the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) and its registry system. This means you can easily add Plate UI components to your project using familiar commands.

- **shadcn CLI Compatible:** Use the standard `shadcn add` command to fetch components.
- **Registry Schema:** Components are defined using the [shadcn/ui registry schema](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-json), ensuring compatibility and a standardized structure.
- **Build Your Own:** While Plate UI provides a curated set of components, the system is built so you could even host your own registry of Plate-compatible components.


## Beautiful Defaults

Plate UI comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:

- **Good Out-of-the-Box:** Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
- **Easily Customizable:** If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.

## AI-Ready

The design of Plate UI makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.

_An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design._

## MCP-Ready

Plate includes **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** compatibility, enabling AI-assisted component management and synchronization.

- **Integration:** MCP helps AI understand your project's styling, dependencies, and even setup requirements like installation or configurations, directly from the Plate registry.
- **Maintenance:** When a component in the Plate registry is updated, AI (powered by tools like Cursor) can help pull, merge, and apply these changes effortlessly.

## FAQ

<Accordion type="multiple">

<AccordionItem value="faq-shadcn-replacement">
<AccordionTrigger>
Is it a replacement to shadcn/ui?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

No, it's not a replacement to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
Instead, Plate UI an extended collection of components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), specifically designed for **rich-text editor** design. For other parts of your app, you should continue to use other components such as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Plate UI adheres to the same conventions, usage, and patterns as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), meaning you can seamlessly integrate it with your existing [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components rather than replacing them.

<AccordionItem value="faq-open-code-updates">
  <AccordionTrigger>
    How do I pull upstream updates in an Open Code approach?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    <p>
      Plate UI follows a headless component architecture. This means the core
      of your app can receive fixes by updating your dependencies.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-4">
      The topmost layer, i.e., the one closest to your design system (the code you copy into your project), is not
      coupled with the implementation of the library. It stays open for
      modification. For updates to this layer, you can manually compare and integrate changes from the Plate UI source.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-4">
      Additionally, with MCP compatibility, AI tools can assist in pulling, merging, and applying updates from the Plate registry, further simplifying the update process.

<AccordionItem value="faq-copy-paste">
<AccordionTrigger>
Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled. This aligns with our "Open Code" principle.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._

<AccordionItem value="faq-npm-package">
<AccordionTrigger>
    Do you plan to publish it as an npm package?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    No. We have no plans to publish it as an npm package, to maintain the "Open Code" philosophy and give you full control.

<AccordionItem value="faq-frameworks-supported">
<AccordionTrigger>
Which frameworks are supported?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

[Plate](/docs) (for the editor itself) and any framework that supports React for using the UI components. This includes [Next.js](/docs/components/installation/next), [Remix](/docs/components/remix), etc.
