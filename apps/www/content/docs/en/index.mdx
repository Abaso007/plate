description: The rich-text editor framework for React.
---

Plate is a powerful toolkit that makes it easier for you to develop with [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/), a popular framework for building text editors. Plate is designed with principles of **Openness**, **Composition**, and **Headless** through its ecosystem.

It focuses on three main areas: **Core Engine**, **Extensible Plugins**, and **Customizable Components (Plate UI)**.

## Core Engine

The heart of Plate is its plugin system, designed for React, with support for server-side rendering. This allows you to understand and extend the editor's foundation. It helps keep your project organized and efficient by separating different functionalities. It also includes a framework agnostic API, allowing for server-side rendering and non-React usage.

## Extensible Plugins

Plate offers a wide range of plugin packages that enhance the behavior, hooks, serialization, normalization, and other features of the editor. These plugins are "headless" (unstyled by default) and designed for **Composition**, allowing you to mix and match functionalities to build a tailored editing experience. The plugin system includes:

- **State Management**: Each plugin can have its own Zustand store.
- **Shortcuts**: Define custom hotkeys for each plugin.
- **API and Transforms**: Plugins can define their own API methods and transforms, accessible through `editor.api` and `editor.transforms`.
- **TypeScript**: Powerful type inference for both plugins and editor, enhancing developer experience and AI-readiness of your codebase.

## Customizable Components

To accelerate development with a visually appealing interface and pre-configured functionality, Plate provides **Plate UI**. This is a collection of resources, available via our CLI and an MCP-enabled registry, that you can integrate into your project.

Plate UI includes:

- **UI Components:** Pre-built, styled components for editor elements (toolbars, blocks, marks, etc.), built on shadcn/ui and Radix UI.
- **Editor Blocks:** Full editor configurations (e.g., `editor-ai` â€“ a complete AI-powered editor setup) that you can use as a starting point.
- **Individual Plugins:** Configured plugins ready to be integrated.

Following an **Open Code** model inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), you copy the code for these resources into your project, giving you full ownership.

- **Own Your Code:** Modify and extend any resource directly.
- **Beautiful & Functional Defaults:** Start with a polished look and working editor configurations.
- **AI-Ready:** MCP and our open code make these resources transparent for AI tools to assist with customization, integration, and generation. [Learn more about MCP](/docs/components/mcp).
- **Distribution via CLI:** Easily add Plate UI resources to your project.

These resources can be used as a reference or starting point for your own editor builds and component libraries, enabling you to create unique, accessible, and visually pleasing user interfaces and experiences.

## FAQ

Which frameworks are Plate compatible with?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Plate's core logic and plugin system are built with [Slate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slate) and [Slate React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slate-react). The core can be used in any React environment.

<AccordionTrigger>
What's the difference between Plate and Plate UI?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

**Plate** is the underlying rich-text editor framework. It provides the core engine, plugin system, and headless functionalities for building powerful text editors with Slate.

**Plate UI** is a collection of pre-styled, customizable UI components, editor blocks (templates), plugin sets, and individual plugins that you can use with the Plate framework. It follows the shadcn/ui philosophy of copying code into your project, giving you full ownership. You use these resources to build and customize the user interface *and* the core configuration *for* your Plate editor.

	<AccordionContent>
Yes. Plate (both the core framework and Plate UI) is free to use for personal and commercial projects. No attribution required, but sharing your editor app [here](https://github.com/udecode/plate/discussions/2523) is appreciated!
