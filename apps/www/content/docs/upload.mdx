### UploadThing Integration

The UploadThing integration provides an easy way to handle file uploads in your editor. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @uploadthing/react uploadthing
   ```

2. Install the [media-placeholder-element](/docs/components/media-placeholder-element) component.

3. Set up the UploadThing API route by copying the [example implementation](https://github.com/udecode/plate/blob/main/templates/plate-playground-template/src/app/api/uploadthing/core.ts).

4. Get your UploadThing API key from the [dashboard](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard) and add it to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```


### Using your own backend

To implement your own backend for file uploads:

1. Remove the UploadThing implementation:
   ```bash
   lib/uploadthing/
   api/uploadthing/
   ```

2. Create your own upload hook:
   ```ts
   function useUploadFile() {
     // Your implementation here
     return {
       isUploading: boolean,
       progress: number,
       uploadFile: (file: File) => Promise<UploadedFile>,
       uploadedFile: UploadedFile | undefined,
       uploadingFile: File | undefined
     }
   }
   ```

3. The hook should match the interface expected by the media placeholder component:
   ```ts
   interface UploadedFile {
     key: string
     url: string
     name: string
     size: number
     type: string
   }
   ```
