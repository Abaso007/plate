Plate provides a suite of plugins for common elements like paragraphs, headings (H1-H6), blockquotes, and horizontal rules.\n\nWhile each of these elements can be configured and used individually, Plate also offers the `BasicBlocksKit` as a convenient way to include a pre-configured set of these common block elements along with their recommended UI components.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use the basic element plugins, install the basic nodes package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @udecode/plate-basic-nodes\n```\n\nFor a quick start with pre-configured UI components and plugins, you can add the `basic-blocks-kit` using the Plate UI CLI:\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add https://platejs.org/r/basic-blocks-kit\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n<Steps>\n\n### Using the `BasicBlocksKit`\n\nThe `BasicBlocksKit` bundles plugins for Paragraphs, Headings (H1, H2, H3), Blockquotes, and Horizontal Rules, along with their respective UI components from Plate UI.\n\n```tsx\nimport { createPlateEditor } from '@udecode/plate/react';\nimport { BasicBlocksKit } from '@/components/editor/plugins/basic-blocks-kit';\n\nconst editor = createPlateEditor({\n  plugins: [\n    // ...otherPlugins,\n    ...BasicBlocksKit,\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nThis is the quickest way to get started with a full set of basic block elements.\n\n<ComponentSource name=\"basic-blocks-kit\" />\n\n</Steps>\n",
