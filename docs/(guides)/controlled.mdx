title: Controlled Editor Value
description: How to control the editor value.
---

Implementing a fully controlled editor value in Plate (and Slate) is complex due to several factors:

1. The editor state includes more than just the content (`editor.children`). It also includes `editor.selection` and `editor.history`.

2. Directly replacing `editor.children` can break the selection and history, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

3. All changes to the editor's value should ideally happen through [Transforms](https://docs.slatejs.org/api/transforms) to maintain consistency with selection and history.

Given these challenges, it's generally recommended to use Plate as an uncontrolled input. However, if you need to make external changes to the editor's content, you can use `editor.tf.setValue(value)` function.

<Callout type="warning" title="Performance Consideration">
  Using `editor.tf.setValue` will re-render all nodes on each call, so it
  should be used carefully and sparingly. It may impact performance if used
  frequently or with large documents.
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can use `editor.tf.reset()` to reset the editor state, which will reset the selection and history.

### Async Initial Value

You can use `skipInitialization` to delay editor initialization until your async data is ready. Then, call `editor.tf.init` with your value:

```tsx
function AsyncControlledEditor() {
  const [initialValue, setInitialValue] = React.useState();
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);
  const editor = usePlateEditor({
    skipInitialization: true,
  });

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate async fetch
    setTimeout(() => {
      setInitialValue([
        {
          type: 'p',
          children: [{ text: 'Loaded async value!' }],
        },
      ]);
      setLoading(false);
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading && initialValue) {
      editor.tf.init({ value: initialValue, autoSelect: 'end' });
    }
  }, [loading, initialValue, editor]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loadingâ€¦</div>;

  return (
    <Plate editor={editor}>
      <EditorContainer>
        <Editor />
      </EditorContainer>
    </Plate>
  );
}
```
