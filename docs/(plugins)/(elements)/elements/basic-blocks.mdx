## Overview

Basic elements are fundamental building blocks for any rich-text editor, allowing users to structure and organize their content effectively. Plate provides a suite of plugins for common elements like paragraphs, headings (H1-H6), blockquotes, and horizontal rules.

While each of these elements can be configured and used individually, Plate also offers the `BasicElementsKit` as a convenient way to include a pre-configured set of these common block elements along with their recommended UI components.

## Installation

To use the basic element plugins, install the basic nodes package:

```bash
npm install @udecode/plate-basic-nodes
```

For a quick start with pre-configured UI components and plugins, you can add the `basic-elements-kit` using the Plate UI CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://platejs.org/r/basic-elements-kit
```

## Usage

<Steps>

### Using the `BasicElementsKit`

The `BasicElementsKit` bundles plugins for Paragraphs, Headings (H1, H2, H3), Blockquotes, and Horizontal Rules, along with their respective UI components from Plate UI.

```tsx
import { createPlateEditor } from '@udecode/plate/react';
import { BasicElementsKit } from '@/components/editor/plugins/basic-elements-kit';

const editor = createPlateEditor({
  plugins: [
    // ...otherPlugins,
    ...BasicElementsKit,
  ],
});
```

This is the quickest way to get started with a full set of basic block elements.
