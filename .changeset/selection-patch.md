'@platejs/selection': minor
---

- Fixed `duplicateBlockSelectionNodes` by removing the `nextBlock: true` option
- Added `mod+d` hotkey to duplicate selected blocks
- Added character input handling in block selection - typing a character now replaces selected blocks with a new block containing that character
- Added support for node and mark operations (bold, italic, etc.)
